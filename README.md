This is a smart contract that showcases an exemplary scenario by utilizing nested structs and mappings within a primary struct. In this contract I created a main struct, then created a secondary struct, and within this secondary struct,I establish a mapping that links it to another struct. Furthermore I creacted a function that sets the values and returns it.
